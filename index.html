<h1>Preferred</h1>
<h1>Brewing Method</h1>

<p>This is my personal favorite way to brew of all the different methods I have tried so far. I learned this method from Blue Bottle Coffee. I prefer pour over coffee using a Chemex. If you're interested in any of the tools I use, make sure to check out the Gear page. Anyways, let's get right into it. </p>

<h2>Step 1</h2>

<p>Bring at least 600 grams (20 oz) of water to a boil.</p>

<h2>Step 2</h2>

<p>Grind 23 grams of coffee (3 tbsp) to a coarseness resembling sea salt. I like lighter roasts of coffee for this, if you are using a darker roast.</p>
